# Modularity Resource Booking

Book a resource for a predefined period of time. This plugin provides a api-based frontend. 

## Why is the order posttype called purchase? 
You cannot name a posttype "order" in WordPress. This is a reserved keyword that will break all post-listings. We have renamed it to "purchase" but still want to present the name as "order" due to simplicity & logical reasons for the user.
